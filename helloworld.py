#Comments
'''A comment is just a line with anything written on, but isn't run. They are usually used to increase readability and explain parts of a program.

When you put a #, everything after that on that line will not be run (they will be a comment).'''

#e.g.

#This is a print statement
print("hello world")

#1.1 Write a print statement that says another greeting, like "Hi" or "Hey"
