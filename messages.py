#Variables are "things" that hold data for use later in a program
'''Make sure that you name your variable something that describes the data that it holds (so not just 'a' or 'b' or something like that)'''

#To create a variable use a name = value assignment
message = "This is a message"
print (message)

#Naming variables
'''There are a few key rules when naming variables.
They are:
No spaces
Don't start with a number
Not a keyword (e.g. print, int)
Don't start with capital letter'''


#1-2 simple message
'''write your own message in a variable and print it'''


#1-3 More simple messages
'''write a new message variable (like message2 = "", print it, then change the message and print it again.'''


#Using f-strings
'''To use a variable in a print statement you can use a f-string like this'''
weather = "rain"
print(f"The weather is {weather}")


#1-4 personal message
'''Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and print
a message to that person using an f-string. Your message should be simple, such as, “Hello Eric,
would you like to learn some Python today?”'''


#To do mathematical operations you can use +, -, / and *
#e.g print(5+6) will output 11

#1-5 print the answer to 4*2
